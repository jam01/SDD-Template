## 2. Design Overview
💬 _Describes the nature and approach of the system architecture and design._

### 2.1 Stakeholder Concerns
💬 _Defines key stakeholders and their design-related interests._

➥ Identify stakeholder types (e.g., users, developers, operators), their main concerns (e.g., availability, maintainability, risk mitigation) and the viewpoints or design elements of this document that address them.

### 2.2 Selected Viewpoints
💬 _Defines the perspectives used to represent and reason about the system’s design._

➥ Identify and describe the viewpoints that were selected to address the stakeholders' concerns identified in Section 2.1. Each viewpoint addresses specific stakeholder concerns and utilizes visualization languages (e.g., UML, C4, sequence diagrams). Note which concerns each viewpoint addresses.

#### 2.2.1 Context
💬 _Defines the system as a black box, identifying its boundaries and its environment._

**Addresses:** System boundaries, environment actors (users, external systems) and offered services (use cases).  
**Typical Languages:** UML Use Case Diagram, C4 Context Diagram.

#### 2.2.2 Composition
💬 _Describes how the system is recursively assembled from major constituent parts (subsystems, components, or modules), and how those are organized and relate to one another_

**Addresses:** Identify the major design elements; allocation of responsibilities, and localization of functionality; modularity (reuse, buy-vs-build) and integration.  
**Typical Languages:** UML Component Diagram, Hierarchical Decomposition Diagram, UML Package (functional), Deployment (runtime) Diagram.

💡 Tips:
- Focus on how components fit together and where external, reused, or third-party components integrate.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Functional (logical) decomposition and Runtime (physical) decomposition.

#### 2.2.3 Logical
💬 _Captures the static design structure of the system in terms of types and their implementation (class, interface) and their relationships._

**Addresses:** Development and reuse of appropriate abstractions and their implementations; encapsulation and dependencies among entities.  
**Typical Languages:** UML Class Diagram, UML Object Diagram.

💡 Tips: 
- Focus on the static and stable abstractions that collaborate to fulfill system goals. 
- Complements Composition (assembly) by clarifying the abstractions that underlie it.

#### 2.2.4 Physical
💬 _Depicts the tangible system infrastructure._

**Addresses:** Hardware configuration, physical topology, and physical constraints.  
**Typical Languages:** Hardware Block Diagram, Network Topology Diagram, Rack Layout, Cloud Infrastructure Diagram.

💡 Tips:
- Complements Deployment by showing the platform topology on which software is mapped.

#### 2.2.5 Structure
💬 _Documents internal organization of components and their parts, ports, and connectors_.

**Addresses:** Internal composition of complex entities; reusability of fine-grained components.  
**Typical Languages:** UML composite structure diagram, UML class diagram, UML package diagram, C4 Container diagram.

💡 Tips: 
- Complements Composition by focusing on interfaces and connectors.

#### 2.2.6 Dependency
💬 _Shows how design elements interconnect and access each other, illustrating import, service, or build-time relationships._

**Addresses:** Integration needs and prioritization; coupling and dependencies; root cause and change impact analysis.  
**Typical Languages:** UML Package Diagram, Dependency Graph, UML Component Diagram

💡 Tips: 
- Draw dependencies directionally (“uses”, “requires”, “provides”).

#### 2.2.7 Information
💬 _Models the persistent data structure, its relationships, and the mechanisms for access and management._

**Addresses:** Data structure and semantics; persistence; metadata; data integrity; data management and access schemes.  
**Typical Languages:** Entity-Relationship Diagram, UML Class Diagram, Logical Data Model.

💡 Tips: 
- Use consistent naming with the Logical viewpoint to maintain type alignment.

#### 2.2.8 Interface
💬 _Specifies the externally visible interfaces among components, subsystems, or with external systems._

**Addresses:** Interoperability through contract definition; encapsulation, and integration risks.  
**Typical Languages:** API specifications, IDLs, function/method signature, UML Component Diagram

#### 2.2.9 Interaction
💬 _Illustrates how entities collaborate at runtime via messages: who talks to whom, in what order, and under which conditions._

**Addresses:** Allocation of responsibilities; message sequencing, timing, and synchronization; error propagation; distributed components state transition logic and concurrency.  
**Typical Languages:** UML Sequence Diagram, UML Collaboration Diagram, BPMN Process Flows.

💡 Tips:
- Provide representative “happy-path” and “failure-path” scenarios.
- If concurrency affects ordering, annotate lifelines/regions and reference the Concurrency viewpoint.

💡 Tips: 
- Cross-reference with Concurrency (timing) and Deployment (placement) views for a full runtime picture..

## 3. Design Views
💬 _Documents the main architectural and design elements that define the system._

➥ Define design views to a level of detail sufficient to implement the system (prescriptive architecture) or to understand how to operate or maintain the existing product (descriptive architecture). Use unique identifiers, keep elements concise and modular, and include diagrams or links where applicable. Reference relevant design decisions from Section 4 that this view represents. Include applicable SRS requirement IDs that this element implements when available.

📃 Template:
```markdown
- ID: [NNN]-{title}
- Title: Short, descriptive name of the view.
- Viewpoint: The viewpoint of which this view is an instance.
- Representation: The design view representation per the viewpoint and language selected, e.g., natural language description or a diagram or a combination thereof.
- More Information: Additional context. Links to related artifacts.
```

💡 Tips:
- This section should contain enough information to implement the system (prescriptive architecture) or to understand how to operate or maintain the existing product (descriptive architecture).
- If available, include references to the SRS requirement IDs that the design view implements. This demonstrates how requirements are addressed by the design.
- Reference relevant design decisions from Section 4 that influenced or resulted from this design element.

## 4. Decisions
💬 Captures significant architectural or design decisions and their rationale.

➥ Document significant architectural decisions that have substantial long-term impact on the system's structure,
behavior, or quality attributes.

```markdown
- ID: [NNN]-{title}
- Title: short title, representative of solved problem and found solution.
- Context: Describe the context and problem statement.
- Options: Enumerate considered alternatives.
- Outcome: Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because {justification}.
- More Information: Additional context. Links to related artifacts.
```

💡 Tips:
- Keep one decision per record.
- Consider adopting MADR (Markdown Architecture Decision Record) pattern directly to document decisions. 

## 5. Appendixes
💬 _Optional supporting material that aids understanding without being normative._

➥ Include glossaries, data dictionaries, models/diagrams, sample datasets, or change-impact analyses that support the main sections. Reference rather than duplicate content when possible.

💡 Tips:
- Keep appendixes organized and referenced from the main text.
